# F1 Data Analysis 🏎

Welcome to the F1 Data Analysis for the 2022 season! 🏎

This repo will contain my workings (both Data Science and analysis) of how the drivers are doing in the 2022 season.

This will be using the data from the Race Result initially.

## Getting started

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management. Make sure you have Poetry installed!

Once you have Poetry installed, run the following in your terminal:

```
poetry install
```

And then:

```
poetry shell
```

This will create the virtual environment to run the cells in the Jupyter notebook. Choose the newly created virtual environment as the kernel in the Jupyter notebook.
